### Description

Implement an application that will find the shortest routes between two points, given the points and distances between them.

Below is a table of routes and their distances. Each route can be travelled in either direction:

| Point Start | End Point | Distance |
|---|---|---|
| A | C | 2 |
| C | D | 1 |
| C | F | 4 |
| B | D | 4 |
| B | E | 7 |
| D | F | 1 |
| D | G | 2 |
| F | G | 3 |
| G | H | 4 |
| E | H | 10 |

As an example, to get from B to H there are a number of routes (below list is not exhaustive):
- B, E, H
- B, D, G, H
- B, D, C, F, G, H And so on...

The application should return the shortest route in terms of distance travelled, not how many hops were made.
In the example above, the shortest route is B, D, G, H â€“ which gives a distance of 10. 

There is a route with fewer hops, B, E, H, but it has a greater distance of 17 which means that is not the shortest route.Requirements

This should be a vanilla Javascript application, no libraries or frameworks

You should be writing Unit Tests for core functionality
